    <p class="p-2">The <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless</a> framework allow us to manage and deploy
        serverless applications on several platforms such as Azure and AWS.
        In this post, I will walk you through the steps of creating a website using Angular 9.0.7 and deploy it using
        the
        Serverless framework to AWS.</p>

    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serverless CLI</li>
            <li>Angular CLI</li>
            <li>AWS-CLI</li>
            <li>AWS account</li>
            <li>Code editor such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
            <li>Possitive attitude towards life</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Installing the required software</h3>
    <p>Lets start by installing the Serverless framework. If you are on Mac/Linux and have the <code>npm</code>
        machage manager you can install it
        using the command:
        <code>npm install -g serverless</code>.
        If you are on Windows you will have to use the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> machage manager
        command: <code>choco install serverless</code>.
    </p>

    <p>To install Angular we can use <code>npm</code> again and install it with:
        <code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>
    </p>

    <h3>Create a new Angular project</h3>
    <p>To creata a new project using Angular, open the command line and execute: <code>ng new my-serverless-app</code>.
        The command will ask you if you would like "Angular routing".
        This is a personal choice. I pressed "y" to agree adding it. Next, you will be prompted to select a "stylesheet
        format".
        Again, this is a personal choice so choose your prefered stype format. I chose SCSS. Your project will now be
        generated by the Angular framework.

        <br><br>
        Run the project by executing <code>ng serve --open</code>. That command will build the project and start a web
        server and open our project in your browser.
