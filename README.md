## 1. Install

Install the [Serverless Framework](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless):

```console
$ npm i -g serverless
```

Add the access keys of an AWS IAM Role with `AdministratorAccess` in a `.env` file, using this format:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=1234
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=1234
```

Or, you can set these as environment variables manually before deploying.

## 2. Develop

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


## 3. Deploy

Deploy via the `serverless` command:

```console
$ serverless
```

Use the `--debug` flag if you'd like to learn what's happening behind the scenes:

```console
$ serverless --debug
```

## 4. Notes

If you aren't using a custom domain, AWS Cloudfront and `HTTPS://` will not be set up. Instead, you will receive an `HTTP://` domain from AWS S3.

When you add a custom domain, AWS Cloudfront and `HTTPS://` will be set up automatically with it.

Remember, once you deploy with a custom domain for the first time, it may take up to an hour for DNS servers to propagate that change.
